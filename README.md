# ScorwViewMoveAndDragUI
ScorwViewMoveAndDragUI is Unity2017.2.2

There is a DragUI and ScorwView control with btn

DragUI can't drag out the game view,and it drag position has a distance

ScorwView control you can give it a scrowView and Movenum,it can use a better speed to move,and if your num was change,it will change

but the speed was invariant 

thanks to use it
